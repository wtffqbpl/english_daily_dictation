## Lession 3
Ok, dictation No2, was it easy for you? Well, Gourge has the first line
and he says what time do you have? And Jery responsed I have five o'clock.
A lot of students have 

what time do you have?

what time ===> wha--time 可以连读

7 Hs --- he/her/him/his/had/him/has/have
These 7 Hs is very common daily english, a lot of native speakers speak fast and speak quickly.
we cancel `h` sound, 

so I have ---> I ave 

I have five o'clock ---> I a five o'clock.
这里是因为 `have` 中的 `ve` 和 `five` 的 `f` 发音相同，因此可以省略 `ve` 的发音。

> What time do you have?
> I have 5 o'clock.

speak english like a human.
or you can look your watch. what time do you have? and you gonna check your watch.
Oh, i've five o'clock.

> there're three things I have learned Never to discuss with people, relgions, politics, and great pumpkin.

No1, relegion do not discuss relegions with people. Linus is 6 years old, and he knows this? what Jesus
No2, politics, never discuss plitics with people,
and No3, great pumpkin.

Do you want to know great pumpkin what it is? Do you know santa claus, most many many children around
the world believe santa claus, santa claus who is the person 

In America, and other countries, halloween linus believes 

there's a great pumpkin that comes and delivers to children who believe.

unfortunately, there's only linus believes great pumpkin. If he talks great pumpkin, other people
thinks he is crazy.
So he doesn't talk about the great pumpkin.

well, we're ready to dictation for No 4, and the dictation No 4 is from the movie "the pursue of happiness"

keep working hard, 

> don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

Three STRONG sounds: s/n/l

Three WEAK sounds: d/t/th

If there's a [d|t|th] next to the [s|n|l], many times, these WEAK sounds are canceled.

* You and I : 这里的 d 不发音, 因此正确的发音为: You a ni

* international: 这里的 inter 中的t 不发音，因为前面的n让t不发音, 导致最终的发音为 [inernational] 这个音

* don't ever : t，由于前面的n，导致不发音,因此这个语句的发音为 donever 

* let ---> 发音为: le 

GRAMMATICALLY: "somebody" should be "anybody" ("not" goes with "any~")... But please
don't worry about grammar.

* can't --- n 导致 t 不发音

* something --- 发音为: sump'n ( 这里的p不发音 )
