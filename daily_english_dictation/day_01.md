You have an excellent teaching style. Thank you sooo much.
Finally I found my learning style. You are the best English
teacher in the YouTube. I am sure these videos that you made
will be so useful for million of people.

I really like your way of teaching english. It really makes me
feel like learning real American pronuncation.
