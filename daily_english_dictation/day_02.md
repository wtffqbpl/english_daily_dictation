Ok, dictation No2, was it easy for you? Well, Gourge has the first line
and he says what time do you have? And Jery responsed I have five o'clock.
A lot of students have 

what time do you have?

what time ===> wha--time 可以连读

7 Hs --- he/her/him/his/had/him/has/have
These 7 Hs is very common daily english, a lot of native speakers speak fast and speak quickly.
we cancel `h` sound, 

so I have ---> I ave 

I have five o'clock ---> I a five o'clock.
这里是因为 `have` 中的 `ve` 和 `five` 的 `f` 发音相同，因此可以省略 `ve` 的发音。

> What time do you have?
> I have 5 o'clock.

speak english like a human.
or you can look your watch. what time do you have? and you gonna check your watch.
Oh, i've five o'clock.

In America, and other countries, halloween linus believes 

there's a great pumpkin that comes and delivers to children who believe.

Three STRONG sounds: s/n/l

Three WEAK sounds: d/t/th

If there's a [d|t|th] next to the [s|n|l], many times, these WEAK sounds are canceled.

* You and I : 这里的 d 不发音, 因此正确的发音为: You a ni

* international: 这里的 inter 中的t 不发音，因为前面的n让t不发音, 导致最终的发音为 [inernational] 这个音

* don't ever : t，由于前面的n，导致不发音,因此这个语句的发音为 donever 

* let ---> 发音为: le 

GRAMMATICALLY: "somebody" should be "anybody" ("not" goes with "any~")... But please
don't worry about grammar.

* can't --- n 导致 t 不发音

* something --- 发音为: sump'n ( 这里的p不发音 )

The final sentence:
> I have come here
>  to chew bubblegum
>  and kick ass
>
> and i'm all out of bubblegum!
> ( I have no more bubble gum)

* 这里的 to chew 中的to 在美式发音中最常用的有两种 te,de 这里发音为 de
* and kick ass 中的and，d不发音
* and i'm --> an-dahm
* amd i'm all out of --- an-dah-ma-louda
* out of --- 在美式发音中，经常发音为 outta [ouda] 这里的f，由于后面经常跟着辅音，导致f也不发音

* to kick ass sth -- 表示做某个事情非常好 do sth really really well.

What I learned:
> The secret of life is just live what you want.

The correct sentence is:

> The secret of life is just live every moment.

* secret of ---> secretof, sometimes, f should be omitted.
* life is ---> lifeis
* just 经常发音为 juss
* to 发音为 t'
* live every ---> ve-ev 可以连在一起读, ve可以不发音

* live --- carpe diem! Size the day~  means to live meanfully.

don't waste your time 
do something, be proative, be passionate, be possitive, has no regrets, smile, and dream for the future.
