Ok, dictation No2, was it easy for you? Well, Gourge has the first line
and he says what time do you have? And Jery responsed I have five o'clock.
A lot of students have 

what time do you have?

what time ===> wha--time 可以连读

7 Hs --- he/her/him/his/had/him/has/have
These 7 Hs is very common daily english, a lot of native speakers speak fast and speak quickly.
we cancel `h` sound, 

so I have ---> I ave 

I have five o'clock ---> I a five o'clock.
这里是因为 `have` 中的 `ve` 和 `five` 的 `f` 发音相同，因此可以省略 `ve` 的发音。

> What time do you have?
> I have 5 o'clock.

speak english like a human.
or you can look your watch. what time do you have? and you gonna check your watch.
Oh, i've five o'clock.
